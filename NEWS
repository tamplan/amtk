News in 2.99.2, 2017-07-18
--------------------------

Amtk:
* The biggest change in this release is that the classes and functions related
  to actions and menus have been moved to a new shared library called Amtk
  (Actions, Menus and Toolbars Kit), since it was not really related to text
  editors, it is more general. But Amtk is still developed inside the Tepl
  repository. Amtk is a basic GtkUIManager replacement based on GAction (still
  under development, it is not yet finished, for example it doesn't handle
  toolbars).
* Add AmtkFactory and AmtkFactoryMenu, which replace
  amtk_action_info_store_create_menu_item().

News in 2.99.1, 2017-06-15
--------------------------
* The library has been renamed from Gtef (GTK+ text editor framework) to Tepl
  (Text editor product line), to have a more beautiful name. The end of Tepl is
  pronounced like “apple”.

News in 1.99.2, 2017-03-12
--------------------------

Basic GtkUIManager replacement based on GAction:
* Add an easy way to create a GtkMenuItem from a GtefActionInfo.
* Add a function to check that every GtefActionInfo in a GtefActionInfoStore
  has been used.
* Add reference counting to GtefActionInfo.
* Add GtefActionInfoCentralStore singleton class.
* Add gtef_action_map_add_action_entries_check_dups(), to check if there are
  duplicates when adding GActions to a GActionMap.
* Rename gtef_application_get_action_info_store() to
  gtef_application_get_app_action_info_store().
* Add GtefMenuShell, an extension of GtkMenuShell with the ::menu-item-selected
  and ::menu-item-deselected signals.
* Add gtef_menu_item_get/set_long_description().
* Add GtefApplicationWindow, an extension of GtkApplicationWindow with:
	* A statusbar property.
	* A function to connect a GtefMenuShell to the statusbar,
	  pushing/popping the long descriptions of GtkMenuItems when they are
	  selected/deselected.
	* A function to connect a GtkRecentChooserMenu to the statusbar,
	  pushing/popping the full paths.
	* A function to create a GtkMenuItem with a simple and generic
	  GtkRecentChooserMenu as submenu.

News in 1.99.1, 2017-01-26
--------------------------

Start a basic GtkUIManager replacement based on GAction:
* Add gtef_utils_menu_item_set_icon_name()
* Add GtefActionInfo
* Add GtefActionInfoStore
* Note that those classes are a little out of scope for a text editor library.
  I would be happy to move those classes to a better library once the feature
  is finished and well-tested. The classes were added to Gtef for convenience.

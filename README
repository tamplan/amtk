Amtk - Actions, Menus and Toolbars Kit for GTK applications
===========================================================

This is version 5.0.2 of Amtk.

Amtk is the acronym for “Actions, Menus and Toolbars Kit”. It is a basic
GtkUIManager replacement based on GAction. It is suitable for both a
traditional UI or a modern UI with a GtkHeaderBar.

The Amtk library is free software and is released under the terms of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, see the 'COPYING' file for more information.

Dependencies
------------

- GLib >= 2.52
- GTK >= 3.22

Installation
------------

Simple install procedure from a tarball:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  $ make install

See the file 'INSTALL' for more detailed information.

From the Git repository, the 'configure' script and the 'INSTALL' file are not
yet generated, so you need to run 'autogen.sh' instead, which takes the same
arguments as 'configure'.

To build the latest version of Amtk plus its dependencies from Git, Jhbuild is
recommended:
